\begin{frame}{Policy Recommendations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item self-driving cars $\rightarrow$ less traffic delay
    \item at best, will only reduce --- not eliminate --- major traffic delays
    \item for roads three lanes and wider, designate a lane for the exclusive use of self-driving cars when self-driving cars account for 5\% or more of vehicles on the road
	\item the potential of autonomous vehicles to increase total traffic volume \cite{Org2014Www.vtpi.orgPlanning} must be seriously and actively considered by policy makers
\end{itemize}
